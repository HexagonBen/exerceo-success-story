              <p>
                Ben came to Exerceo with no computer science degree, and no 
                professional experience as a software engineer. He had been a
                registered nurse for 5 years, and decided to make a career
                change.
              </p>

              <p>
                Although Ben's resume carried nothing relevant to software
                engineering aside from a handful of certificates from a
                non-accredited online bootcamp, Exerceo gave Ben a supportive
                environment to learn in, and the chance to showcase what he did 
                bring to the table already: a positive attitude, reliability,
                and a ravenous appetite for learning. Over the course of a few
                months, Ben progressed through Exerceo's rigorous immersion
                program.
              </p>

              <p>
                Ben's career is just getting started, but with Exerceo's help, 
                Ben is well on his way to developing himself into an valuable 
                asset.
